**Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C. The game supports two modes:

(a) Human vs. Human

(b) Human vs. Computer (with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Difficult)

**Prerequisites**

To run this game, you need a C compiler (like GCC) installed on your system.

**Game Modes**

Human vs. Human: Two players can play against each other.

Human vs. Computer: Play against the computer. The difficulty of the computer can be set to Easy, Medium, or Difficult.


**Difficulty Levels**

Easy: The computer randomly selects a move.

Medium: The computer attempts to block the human player's winning moves while making some smart choices.

Difficult: The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to always make the optimal move, making it very challenging to beat.

You can choose between Easy, Medium, or Difficult.


**Input Your Moves:**
